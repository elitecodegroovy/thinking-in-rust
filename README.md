gs
------------
gs is a line-oriented search tool that recursively searches your current
directory for a regex pattern. By default, gs will respect your .gitignore
and automatically skip hidden files/directories and binary files. gs
has first class support on Windows, macOS and Linux, with binary downloads
available for [every release](https://github.com/BurntSushi/gs/releases).
gs is similar to other popular search tools like The Silver Searcher, ack
and grep.
