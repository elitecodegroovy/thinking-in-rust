To profile your Rust code, you can use tools like `perf`, `flamegraph`, or `valgrind`. Profiling helps identify
performance bottlenecks and areas that may need optimization.

## ?

The ? operator in Rust, often referred to as the “try”
operator, is a powerful tool that significantly simplifies error
propagation and handling. It is designed to streamline the
process of returning early from a function when an error
occurs and automatically propagate the error up the call
stack. This operator plays a pivotal role in enhancing the
readability and maintainability of your code, especially when
dealing with functions that return Result or Option types.
